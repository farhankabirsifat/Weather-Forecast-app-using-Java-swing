Weather Forecast app using Java swing. It can show weather condition of any location on earth. It can also show the room temperature and humidity.
I use here OpenWeather API to show weather conditions of any location and use Blynk IOT API to show Room temperature and humidity.
I also use a ESP32 & DHT22 sensor to read Room temperature and humidity.
