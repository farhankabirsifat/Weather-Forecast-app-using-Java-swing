# üåç Weather Forecast App using Java Swing

This Java Swing application provides weather forecasts for any location worldwide and displays real-time room temperature and humidity. It utilizes the **OpenWeatherMap API** for global weather data and the **Blynk IoT platform**, in conjunction with an **ESP32** microcontroller and a **DHT22** sensor, for local room environment monitoring.

## üöÄ Features

- **Global Weather Forecast**  
  Displays current weather conditions (temperature, description, feels like, min/max temperature, humidity, wind speed) for any searched city.
  
- **Visual Weather Icons**  
  Shows appropriate icons based on the current weather condition.
  
- **Room Environment Monitoring**  
  Shows live room temperature and humidity readings obtained from an ESP32 and DHT22 sensor via Blynk.
  
- **Location Search**  
  Allows users to search for weather information for different locations.
  
- **Dynamic Updates**  
  Room temperature and humidity data are updated periodically.
  
- **Custom Look and Feel**  
  Uses the JTattoo Aluminium Look and Feel for the UI.
